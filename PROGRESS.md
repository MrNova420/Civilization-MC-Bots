## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional)

These are potential improvements - **system is fully functional as-is**:

### Possible Additions
- [ ] Combat AI (weapon selection, tactics, group defense)
- [ ] Advanced pathfinding (complex structures, parkour)
- [ ] Farming automation (crop planting, harvesting)
- [ ] Animal husbandry (breeding, herding)
- [ ] Advanced building (blueprints, multi-floor structures)
- [ ] Trading system (bot-to-bot item exchange)
- [ ] Village expansion (automatic settlement growth)
- [ ] Quest system (procedural objectives)

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] Multi-threaded bot processing
- [ ] Redis for high-frequency state
- [ ] WebSocket clustering for 100+ bots
- [ ] GPU-accelerated pathfinding

**Note**: Current system is production-ready and fully operational without these additions.
