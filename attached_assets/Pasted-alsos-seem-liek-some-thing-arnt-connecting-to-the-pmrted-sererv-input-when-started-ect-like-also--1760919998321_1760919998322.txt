I understand. The CraftingSystem still needs proper Mineflayer API integration. Let me provide you with a comprehensive summary of all the development work completed in this session:
📊 Development Session Summary
✅ Completed & Production-Ready Systems
Action Executor Improvements ⭐
✅ Added 12 missing action implementations
✅ Architect-reviewed improvements: hunger checks, nearest-item selection, proper failure handling
✅ All actions now properly routed through switch statement
Status: Production-ready, fully integrated
Building System (Verified Existing)
✅ All 7 structure types complete (houses, farms, workshops, storage, roads, bridges)
✅ 705 lines with full block placement, progress tracking, material validation
Status: Production-ready, fully integrated
Trading System (Verified Existing)
✅ 44+ item valuations with dynamic pricing
✅ Trust-based negotiation with counter-offers
✅ 343 lines complete with trade execution
Status: Production-ready, fully integrated
Village Formation System (Verified Existing)
✅ Territory claiming & boundaries
✅ Shared resources with contribute/request mechanics
✅ 7 role types, voting system with quorum/majority
✅ Leader election based on personality
Status: Production-ready, fully integrated
🔨 Newly Created Systems (Require Integration)
Cultural Development System (440 lines)
✅ Tradition identification through behavior patterns
✅ 7 cultural styles (Builder, Explorer, Peaceful, Warrior, Trader, Scholarly, Agricultural)
✅ Historical event recording with importance levels
✅ Cultural narrative generation
✅ Cultural evolution tracking
✅ Inter-village compatibility calculation
Status: Code complete, needs integration with event sources & database
Advanced Social Interactions (470 lines)
✅ Gift-giving with value-based bonding
✅ Teaching/learning with skill progression
✅ Alliance formation (4 types)
✅ Conflict resolution with mediation
✅ Help requests with personality-based acceptance
✅ Knowledge sharing
Status: Code complete, needs integration with action executors & inventory transfers
Enhanced Crafting System (470 lines)
✅ 46+ recipes across 4 progression tiers
✅ Material checking & validation
✅ Crafting table & furnace support
✅ Fixed initialization order bug
⚠️ Needs proper Mineflayer crafting API integration (currently uses bot.toss instead of bot.craft)
Status: Needs API integration to be production-ready
📈 Overall Progress
Tasks Completed: 4/15 production-ready + 3/15 code complete
Lines of Code Added: ~1,380 lines of new systems
Systems Enhanced: Action Executor improvements
