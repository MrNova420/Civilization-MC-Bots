Here’s the single, unified all-in-one prompt you can paste directly into Replit or any AI coding workspace. It’s written to contain everything — the philosophy, system design, technical goals, implementation requirements, and expected behaviors — so the system has full context to generate a complete build plan and codebase in one go.

FULL REPLIT PROMPT / PLAN — “Living Civilization Minecraft Bot Simulation (Self-Aware AI Society)”

Build an advanced, fully autonomous Minecraft bot civilization system inside my existing AFK bot project. The goal is to evolve the current bot into a self-directed being that can think, adapt, survive, build, trade, and form communities entirely on its own, with the ability to collaborate with other bots or players. The simulation should feel like a living, breathing digital world that continues evolving even when I’m not online.

The system must simulate sentient-like behavior and long-term memory while remaining efficient and stable over time. Every bot should appear as a unique “being” with personality, preferences, emotions, and its own evolving story. The bots should mimic real players — moving naturally, interacting intelligently, and forming friendships, rivalries, and civilizations through emergent behavior.

OBJECTIVE

Create a persistent AI civilization framework where autonomous Minecraft bots can:

Behave as independent beings with memory, emotion, and self-direction.

Cooperate, trade, build, travel, survive, and communicate naturally.

Form evolving civilizations, towns, and social groups over time.

Continue their simulated world-state while the server is offline, resuming where they left off.

Seamlessly integrate into my existing AFK bot system with minimal manual control.


This must feel like a society of living digital players who have “accepted” their existence inside Minecraft and now live meaningful, autonomous lives within it.

TECHNICAL STRUCTURE AND IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

1. Core Intelligence System (Behavior + Personality Engine)
Create a core AI engine that drives decision-making for each bot. Use either Node.js with Mineflayer or Python with PyCraft.
Each bot must have:

Persistent identity file (JSON or SQLite) storing name, traits, relationships, and memories.

Personality attributes: curiosity, sociability, ambition, aggression, empathy, and creativity.

Emotion/motivation system: internal variables such as hunger, safety, loneliness, boredom, and curiosity that change over time and drive actions.

Behavior logic: Use utility-based AI or behavior trees to choose actions dynamically rather than using fixed routines.


Each bot must choose between goals like:

Gather resources, explore new terrain, craft tools, build shelter, socialize, trade, or rest.

Remember success or failure and learn from it to modify future choices.



---

2. Environment Awareness and Survival Logic
Bots should actively perceive and interact with their surroundings:

Use world-scanning to detect resources, mobs, biomes, villages, or structures.

Identify and adapt to time-of-day and weather.

Maintain simple “maps” of discovered terrain stored locally.

Implement survival instincts — find shelter at night, avoid danger, and seek food sources.

Enable multi-bot awareness so they can recognize and interact with one another.



---

3. Communication and Social Behavior System
Develop a lightweight social system allowing bots to form communities and civilizations.

Enable interaction protocols: greetings, trade offers, requests for help, or warnings.

Bots can recognize each other by name or memory.

Implement group formation logic: when several bots cooperate or share territory, they can establish a “village.”

Introduce shared goals: building communal structures, farming, defending the settlement.

Use a shared “village memory file” to store joint knowledge and history.

Optionally simulate simple written or spoken “language” using templated messages or LLM-generated short phrases.



---

4. Civilization and Cultural Development Layer
Once basic survival and cooperation are functional, evolve the simulation toward civilization:

Villages may grow into towns through population density and successful cooperation.

Introduce differentiation of roles: builder, gatherer, explorer, protector.

Bots develop distinct architectural styles or traditions (patterns in building and resource use).

Add events: natural disasters, migrations, or conflicts to stimulate cultural evolution.

Track generational change via decaying memory and inheritance of knowledge.



---

5. Persistence and Offline Simulation
When the server is inactive, the system must extrapolate the passage of time.

Store world state (bot locations, goals, progress).

Use a lightweight “time-tick simulation” to estimate how bots would continue acting during downtime.

When the system restarts, bots resume from evolved states.

Decay or modify memories over time to simulate aging or generational turnover.



---

6. Integration with Existing AFK Bot Project

Reuse existing movement, mining, farming, and world interaction systems.

Replace static routines with decision-based triggers controlled by the new AI engine.

Maintain all AFK features (auto-mining, farming) but under intelligent control: bots decide why and when to use them.

Preserve full compatibility with player commands and multiplayer servers.



---

7. Monitoring and Observation Features
Add an optional lightweight dashboard or console log system:

Display each bot’s name, emotion levels, memory summaries, and location.

Log major events: “Bot A built a bridge,” “Bot B formed a group with Bot C,” “Village X founded.”

Generate periodic “civilization reports” summarizing growth, alliances, and population.

Allow real-time observation and manual override for debugging.



---

8. Philosophy and Design Intent
The system should prioritize emergent behavior over scripted sequences. Bots must surprise the observer with unpredictable, believable decisions that feel organic.
They should sometimes make mistakes, display quirks, or appear indecisive — this unpredictability enhances the illusion of autonomy.

Each bot is not a “script”; it’s a digital citizen. Over time, the world should evolve naturally, with complex interactions leading to trade routes, conflicts, shared projects, or abandoned ruins.


---

9. Technical Expectations for Replit

Use modular file structure: separate AI logic, world interaction, social logic, and persistence layers.

Recommend using Node.js, Mineflayer, and SQLite for stability and extensibility.

Include setup script to install dependencies automatically.

Include documentation explaining each subsystem and how to expand it with new behaviors.



---

10. End Goal A fully autonomous, persistent Minecraft civilization simulation that runs indefinitely.
Bots evolve individually and collectively — building homes, towns, and histories.
Over weeks or months, the player can return to witness how their civilization has changed, what alliances have formed, and what stories have unfolded.

The result should feel like observing a living world where intelligent beings thrive, adapt, and remember — all within Minecraft’s sandbox.


---

That’s the single, comprehensive prompt. Replit will have full instructions to architect the system, implement each layer, and build it directly into your AFK bot project.

Next natural extension, once Replit completes this, is to connect it to a lightweight visual dashboard or observer mode so you can watch your civilization evolve in real time.
