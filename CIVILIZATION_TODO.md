## 📝 NOTES

- **Not Actual AI**: All "intelligence" is simulated via algorithms (utility calculations, weighted decisions, state machines). No LLM/GPT integration.
- **Performance First**: Designed for 24/7 operation on low-end devices (Termux/Android).
- **Fully Autonomous**: Once started, system runs indefinitely without human intervention.
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new personalities, actions, and social behaviors via JSON/modules.
