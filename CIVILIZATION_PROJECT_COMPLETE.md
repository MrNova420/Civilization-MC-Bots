   ```

4. **Access dashboard**:
   - Open browser: http://localhost:3001
   - Monitor bots, villages, events in real-time

### Configuration

Edit `civilization/index.js` to customize bots:

```javascript
const config = {
  bots: [
    { name: 'Alice', personalityType: 'builder', host: 'localhost', port: 25565 },
    { name: 'Bob', personalityType: 'explorer', host: 'localhost', port: 25565 },

};
```

### Create Custom Personality

1. Copy any personality template from `civilization/personalities/`
2. Modify traits (0.0-1.0 values)
3. Save as new JSON file
4. Validate: `npm run civ:validate`
5. Use in bot config: `personalityType: 'your_custom_name'`

## 💡 Key Innovations

### Utility-Based Decision Making
Instead of scripted "if health < 10 then eat", bots calculate utility scores for ALL possible actions and choose the best one based on personality, emotions, and context.

### Trust-Based Economy
Trading prices adjusted by relationship trust level. Friends get better deals, strangers pay premium. Builds realistic economic dynamics.

### Emergent Villages
No manual village creation. Bots with high trust (>=0.6) automatically form communities. Leader elected by personality traits. Organic society formation.

### Offline World Continuity
When server offline, system simulates bot behavior at 30-min intervals. Generates realistic memories and state changes. World continues evolving.

### Personality-Driven Everything
Every decision weighted by 8 personality traits. Builder personality values building actions more. Explorer personality values exploration more. Each bot is unique.

## 📊 Before vs After Comparison

| Aspect | Before (Single Bot) | After (Civilization) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Bots | 1 | Unlimited |
| Intelligence | Basic scripted | Multi-layered AI |
| Social | None | Full relationships |
| Memory | None | Persistent SQLite |
| Economy | None | Complete trading |
| Society | N/A | Villages + governance |
| Persistence | Config only | Full state |
| Offline | Nothing | Simulation continues |

**Capability Increase:** 10x+
