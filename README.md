## 🏠 Autonomous Features

### How Player Mode Works:

**Phase 1: Survival (0-10 min)**
- Gathers wood and resources
- Crafts basic tools
- Finds food
- Establishes home location

**Phase 2: Building (10-30 min)**
- Builds foundation
- Constructs walls and roof
- Adds storage chests
- Creates workspace

**Phase 3: Expansion (30+ min)**
- Builds farms
- Mines for resources
- Explores nearby areas
- Expands storage

**Phase 4: Community (1+ hours)**
- Trades with villagers
- Helps other players
- Builds community structures
- **Generates new goals automatically!**

### Dynamic Goal Generation

The bot **never runs out of things to do**. It constantly evaluates:
- Current inventory and resources
- Health and food levels
- Nearby players and villages
- Completed milestones
- Environmental opportunities

Then automatically creates goals like:
- "Need tools? Craft them!"
- "Low on food? Find some!"
- "Players nearby? Interact!"
- "Have excess resources? Trade!"
- "Home established? Expand it!"
