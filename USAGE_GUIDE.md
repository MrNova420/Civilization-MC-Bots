## 🤖 How Bots Work

### Autonomous Intelligence

Each bot makes its own decisions based on:

1. **Survival Needs** (Highest Priority)
   - Health < 10 → Seek safety immediately
   - Hunger < 6 → Find and eat food
   - No shelter → Build or find protection

2. **Personality Traits**
   - **Builders**: Love construction (70% building focus)
   - **Miners**: Prefer underground (80% mining focus)
   - **Farmers**: Food production (75% farming focus)
   - **Explorers**: Wanderlust (85% exploration focus)
   - **Crafters**: Tool creation (70% crafting focus)
   - **Chiefs**: Leadership (90% coordination focus)

3. **Community Needs**
   - Respond to help requests from other bots
   - Share resources when others need them
   - Contribute to community projects
   - Teach skills to less experienced bots

4. **Social Factors**
   - Form friendships with bots they work with
   - Avoid bots they've had conflicts with
   - Seek companionship when lonely
   - Share discoveries with friends

---

## 💬 Bot Communication System

### Real-Time Messaging

Bots communicate with each other in 3 ways:

#### 1. Direct Messages (Whispers)
```
Builder_01 -> Miner_03: "Need 20 cobblestone for project"
Miner_03 -> Builder_01: "I have it! Meet at spawn"
```

#### 2. Broadcasts (Public Announcements)
```
Explorer_02: "Found diamonds at -450, 12, 230!"
All bots nearby hear this and can respond
```

#### 3. Help Requests
```
Crafter_04: "Need help with iron farm! Anyone available?"
Miner_03: "I can help! On my way"
Builder_01: "I'll bring materials!"
```

### Community Coordination

Bots automatically:
- Share discovered resource locations
- Request materials they need
- Offer materials they have excess of
- Coordinate multi-bot construction projects
- Form work teams for large tasks

---

## 🏗️ Building & Construction

### Community Projects

Bots can work together on buildings:

1. **Project Initiation**
   - Chief or Builder starts a project
   - Announces to all bots
   - Lists required resources

2. **Resource Contribution**
   ```
   Project: Community Hall
   Needs: 64 planks, 32 cobblestone, 16 glass
   
   Mason contributes: 32 planks
   Digger contributes: 32 cobblestone  
   Smith contributes: 16 glass
   Progress: 100% → Ready to build!
   ```

3. **Construction**
   - Multiple bots work simultaneously
   - Each contributes based on their skills
   - Progress tracked in real-time

### Building Types

Bots can construct:
- **Houses**: Player homes (8x8 with door, windows, bed)
- **Farms**: Crop production (16x16 tilled area)
- **Workshops**: Crafting areas (furnaces, tables, chests)
- **Roads**: Connecting structures (stone paths)
- **Bridges**: River crossings (wood/stone)
- **Walls**: Defense structures (cobblestone barriers)
- **Towers**: Lookout posts (tall observation points)

---

## 🔧 Crafting System

Bots know how to craft **60+ items**:

#### Tools (All Tiers)
- Wooden → Stone → Iron → Diamond
- Pickaxes, Axes, Shovels, Swords
- Shears, Fishing Rods, Flint & Steel

- Leather, Iron, Diamond
- Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings, Boots

#### Building Blocks

1. Check if they have materials
2. Find nearby crafting table/furnace
3. Navigate to equipment
4. Craft the item
5. Store in inventory
6. Log the achievement

## 🎮 Example Session

### First 30 Minutes

```
00:00 - System starts, 10 bots spawn (8s delays)
00:02 - Mason (Builder): "Hello everyone!"
00:02 - Digger (Miner): "Ready to work!"
00:05 - Elder (Chief): "Let's build a community hall!"
00:05 - Elder broadcasts: "Need 64 planks, 32 stone"
00:07 - Mason: "I'll gather wood!"
00:07 - Digger: "I'll mine stone!"
00:10 - [StateManager] Auto-save: 10 bots, 0 resources
00:12 - Scout (Explorer): "Found oak trees at 120, 65, -30"
00:15 - Mason → Elder: "I have 32 planks to contribute"
00:18 - Digger → Elder: "I have 32 cobblestone"
00:20 - Elder: "Community Hall ready to build!"
00:25 - Mason, Wright building together
00:30 - Community Hall: 45% complete
00:40 - [StateManager] Auto-save: 10 bots, 12 resources, 1 building
```

### Social Interactions

```
Scout explores → Finds diamonds → Broadcasts location
→ All miners head there → Form temporary alliance
→ Share discovered diamonds equally → Strengthen friendships

Harvest low on food → Requests help
→ Sower shares wheat → Trust increases
→ Harvest remembers favor → Reciprocates later
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Edit Presets

File: `civilization/presets/civilization_presets.json`

```json
{
  "small_village": {
    "name": "Small Village",
    "description": "Balanced community",
    "botCount": 10,
    "spawnDelayMs": 12000,
    "roles": {
      "builder": 2,
      "miner": 2,
      "farmer": 2,
      "explorer": 2,
      "gatherer": 1,
      "social": 1
    }
  }
}
```

### Adjust Settings

**Spawn Delay:**
- Faster server: 8000ms
- Normal server: 12000ms
- Throttled server: 15000-20000ms

**Bot Count:**
- Testing: 5 bots
- Production: 10 bots
- High-end server: 25-50 bots

---

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Only 1 Bot Connects

**Cause:** Server throttling connections

**Solution:**
1. Increase spawn delay in preset (15000ms)
2. Reduce bot count temporarily (5 bots)
3. Check if server allows multiple connections

### Bots Keep Reconnecting

**Cause:** Network instability or duplicate logins

**Solution:**
1. Wait 60 seconds between restarts
2. Ensure no other instances running
3. Check server is online and accepting connections

### Auto-Save Errors

**Cause:** Missing database tables

**Solution:**
- Delete `civilization/data/civilization.db`
- Restart system - tables auto-create

### No Dashboard Output

**Cause:** Dashboard server not running

**Solution:**
```bash
node civilization/dashboard/civilization_server.js
# Access: http://localhost:3001
```

## 📝 Tips & Best Practices

### For Best Results

1. **Start Small** - Use small_village (10 bots) first
2. **Monitor First Hour** - Watch dashboard to ensure stability
3. **Let Them Work** - Bots need 15-30 min to establish routines
4. **Check State Saves** - Verify auto-save working every 30s
5. **Graceful Shutdown** - Always use CTRL+C to preserve state

### Optimization

**Low-End Servers:**
- Use tiny_village (5 bots)
- Increase spawn delay to 20s
- Reduce decision cycle frequency

**High-End Servers:**
- Use medium_town (20-25 bots)
- Standard 8-12s spawn delays
- Enable all advanced features
