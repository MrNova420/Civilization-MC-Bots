## ❓ Troubleshooting

### "Connection Refused"
✅ Server is offline - bot will auto-retry
✅ Change server address in CONFIG.json

### "Module not found"
```bash
npm install
```

### High CPU
1. Lower CPU limit in CONFIG.json:
   ```json
   "maxCpuPercent": 30
   ```
2. Or use AFK mode instead of Player mode

### Bot doesn't build home
1. Make sure mode is "player"
2. Give it 10-15 minutes to gather resources first
3. Check dashboard for current activity

### Can't access dashboard
- Try: http://127.0.0.1:5000
- Or: http://[your-ip]:5000

- ✅ **Autonomous goal generation** - creates own objectives
- ✅ **Never stops** - always finds something to do
- ✅ **Builds communities** - interacts like real player
- ✅ **Home & base building** - establishes presence
- ✅ **Resource management** - gathers, stores, trades
- ✅ **Adaptive behavior** - reacts to environment
- ✅ **24/7 stable** - optimized for long-term running
