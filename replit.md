# BetterBender 2.0 - Autonomous Minecraft Bot + Civilization System

### Overview
BetterBender 2.0 is an autonomous Minecraft bot designed for 24/7 operation on low-to-medium end devices. It features advanced player simulation with autonomous goal generation, home building, community interaction, and dynamic task creation, allowing the bot to play the game like a real player. Built with Mineflayer and Node.js, it is optimized for minimal resource usage and includes comprehensive safety features for continuous operation.

A significant new feature is the **Civilization System**, which enables running multiple bots as an autonomous society. These bots possess unique personalities, emotions, memories, and relationships, forming friendships, creating villages, and developing cultures that evolve continuously, even offline. The system aims to create a dynamic, evolving digital society within Minecraft.

### User Preferences
Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

### System Architecture

**UI/UX Decisions:**
- **Web Dashboard:** An Express.js + Socket.IO-based real-time control panel on port 5000 provides live monitoring (health, food, position, tasks, inventory), mode switching, command execution, and bot settings management. It offers visual warnings for low health/food.

**Technical Implementations:**
- **Application Type:** Single-process Node.js application running a Minecraft bot client and a web server for status monitoring.
- **Bot Client Architecture:** Utilizes Mineflayer with a plugin-based architecture (e.g., mineflayer-pathfinder), an event-driven pattern, and a Promise-based queue for sequential command execution. Includes auto-reconnection logic.
- **Autonomous Systems:**
    - **AutonomousGoalGenerator:** Dynamically creates goals based on bot state, inventory, health, nearby players, and milestones.
    - **HomeBuilder:** Finds optimal building locations using a scoring system, considering terrain, resources, and community proximity.
