### 2. New Build Infrastructure

Added comprehensive npm scripts to package.json:

  "test:validate": "node test/comprehensive-validation.js",
  // ... (existing scripts)
}
```

#### Usage:

**Full Build:**
```bash
npm run build
```
Installs dependencies and runs full validation

**Validate Only:**
```bash
npm run validate
```
Runs comprehensive tests and linting

**Quick Validation:**
```bash
npm run test:validate
```
Just the 49-component validation
